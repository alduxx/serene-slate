Mountains teach patience
in their slow becoming
stone upon stone
century upon century

They do not rush
toward the sky
but stand
as testament to time

Each layer tells a story
of pressure transformed
into strength
of chaos become form

We climb seeking conquest
but descend with humility
having learned
that some things cannot be hurried

The peak was never the point
it was always about
learning to breathe
at altitude`;export{n as default};
