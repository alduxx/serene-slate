# 7 Tips for Finding Energy During the Day

Energy management is one of the most underrated skills in modern life. Here are seven practical tips that have helped me maintain consistent energy throughout the day.

## 1. Morning sunlight

Get outside within 30 minutes of waking up. Natural light helps regulate your circadian rhythm and signals your body to produce cortisol at the right times.

## 2. Strategic hydration

Most people are chronically dehydrated. Aim for 8-10 glasses of water throughout the day, starting with a large glass first thing in the morning.

## 3. Movement breaks

Every 60-90 minutes, take a 5-minute movement break. This could be stretching, walking, or even just standing and moving your arms.

## 4. Protein-rich meals

Include protein in every meal to maintain stable blood sugar levels. This prevents the energy crashes that come from carb-heavy meals.

## 5. Power naps

A 20-minute nap between 1-3 PM can significantly boost afternoon productivity without affecting nighttime sleep.

## 6. Cold exposure

A 30-second cold shower or splash of cold water on your face can instantly increase alertness and energy.

## 7. Purposeful rest

Schedule actual rest time. Paradoxically, planned rest often leads to more sustainable energy than trying to power through exhaustion.
