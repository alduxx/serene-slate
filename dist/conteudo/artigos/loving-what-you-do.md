# Loving what you do takes work

If you've read some of my previous articles, you know I firmly adhere to the notion of doing what you love, and loving what you do. Is it a cliché? Yes. Is it an overused expression? Yeah, it is something people should strive for? **Absolutely yes.**

Here's the thing: very few people—a fraction of those who say how what they do—are literally embracing every aspect of their day-to-day work. Loving what you do doesn't mean you're on a cloud nine 24/7, it just means you wade through the muck into whatever it is you do, the work you're meant for. And it doesn't mean you wake up feeling lucky through 'n' thankful into whatever it is you do, the work you work.

The work itself has deep meaning to you and meaning is what keeps you awake into the night—the burning kind of drive, kindly.
