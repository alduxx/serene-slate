## The personal musings of Aldo Monteiro, but without the pressure of authentic fanboyism

I don't buy hype words, walking up early, doing productive weekends, exploiting cities with my wife, and exploring what it means for me to do work that I love, and what it means to love the notion of loving what you do, and doing what you love.

I'm a hard worker. Grit-oriented and focused on building a unique style of creative business. I struggle with the tendency to be busy, and always wish I run a blog in a productive sprint toward something unique.

I'm inspired by pragmatic design and know who are at the top of their game, and I can see how they got there through a mindset that is about something unique.

I'm surprisingly athletic. Other times much more than I should, and am a terrible cook.

I've not really got a blog as much as it is an experiment.

If you want to chat, I'd love to hear from you! I'm pretty good at responding quickly. You can tweet at me here.

**Good Design,**

*Aldo*
