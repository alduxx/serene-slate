I know we’ve only just met
And I don’t mean to move too fast
But I couldn’t sleep last night
because I don’t know your middle name
Or how you take your coffee
And for some reason there’s nothing in the world
I would like to know more except maybe
How your hair looks when it’s messy in the morning
Or what makes you laugh until you cry
Or what makes you laugh when you’re crying
Either or both or all of those facts would be fine

And I know we only just met
And I don’t mean to move too fast
But I swear I couldn’t focus this morning
Because I need to know your preference in take out food
And the dreams you'd never say out loud
But secretly wish to come true
And if I were to buy you flowers
Would you want them to be blue?

And I know we only just met
And I don’t mean to move too fast fast
But suddenly your voice is in my head playing on repeat
And I’ll probably never say this out loud
And I should probably get some sleep
It’s just that everything that’s significant to you
Is significant to me.


And I don’t mean to move too fast
But I would trade spots with Atlas
To hold up the world in hopes that you find joy
Is more than worth an eternity of weight
At least then I would know your world is safe
And if I were Atlas then I would spend eternity
With a smile on my face and joy in my heart
And I know we only just met
But I wouldn’t trade this for the world
But I want you to soar through the heavens
Like the wingéd Icarus before you
And although I couldn’t save him
I will save you
