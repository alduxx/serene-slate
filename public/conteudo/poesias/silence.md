excerpt: "A reflection on the profound lessons found in quietude"

The weight of silence
sits heavy on my chest
like snow on winter branches

Not the silence of absence
but the silence of presence
the kind that fills rooms
with unspoken understanding

In the space between breaths
I find what words cannot hold
the truth that whispers
when the world grows still

We spend our lives
filling every gap with noise
afraid of what we might discover
in the pause

But it is there
in that sacred quiet
that we finally hear
the song we've been singing
all along
